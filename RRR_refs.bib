abstract = {Iterative algorithms for phase retrieval from intensity data are compared to gradient search methods. Both the problem of phase retrieval from two intensity measurements (in electron microscopy or wave front sensing) and the problem of phase retrieval from a single intensity measurement plus a non-negativity constraint (in astronomy) are considered, with emphasis on the latter. It is shown that both the error-reduction algorithm for the problem of a single intensity measurement and the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for the problem of two intensity measurements converge. The error-reduction algorithm is also shown to be closely related to the steepest-descent method. Other algorithms, including the input–output algorithm and the conjugate-gradient method, are shown to converge in practice much faster than the error-reduction algorithm. Examples are shown. },

abstract = {The problem of recovering a signal from its phaseless Fourier transform measurements, called Fourier phase retrieval, arises in many applications in engineering and science. Fourier phase retrieval poses fundamental theoretical and algorithmic challenges. In general, there is no unique mapping between a one-dimensional signal and its Fourier magnitude, and therefore the problem is ill-posed. Additionally, while almost all multidimensional signals are uniquely mapped to their Fourier magnitude, the performance of existing algorithms is generally not well-understood. In this chapter we survey methods to guarantee uniqueness in Fourier phase retrieval. We then present different algorithmic approaches to retrieve the signal in practice. We conclude by outlining some of the main open questions in this field.},

abstract = {Recent advances in convex optimization have led to new strides in the phase retrieval problem over finite-dimensional vector spaces. However, certain fundamental questions remain: What sorts of measurement vectors uniquely determine every signal up to a global phase factor, and how many are needed to do so? Furthermore, which measurement ensembles yield stability? This paper presents several results that address each of these questions. We begin by characterizing injectivity, and we identify that the complement property is indeed a necessary condition in the complex case. We then pose a conjecture that 4M−4 generic measurement vectors are both necessary and sufficient for injectivity in M dimensions, and we prove this conjecture in the special cases where M=2,3. Next, we shift our attention to stability, both in the worst and average cases. Here, we characterize worst-case stability in the real case by introducing a numerical version of the complement property. This new property bears some resemblance to the restricted isometry property of compressed sensing and can be used to derive a sharp lower Lipschitz bound on the intensity measurement mapping. Localized frames are shown to lack this property (suggesting instability), whereas Gaussian random measurements are shown to satisfy this property with high probability. We conclude by presenting results that use a stochastic noise model in both the real and complex cases, and we leverage Cramer–Rao lower bounds to identify stability with stronger versions of the injectivity characterizations.},

abstract = {This paper concerns the problem of recovering an unknown but structured signal $x \in R^n$ from $m$ quadratic measurements of the form $y_r=|<a_r,x>|^2$ for $r=1,2,...,m$. We focus on the under-determined setting where the number of measurements is significantly smaller than the dimension of the signal ($m<<n$). We formulate the recovery problem as a nonconvex optimization problem where prior structural information about the signal is enforced through constrains on the optimization variables. We prove that projected gradient descent, when initialized in a neighborhood of the desired signal, converges to the unknown signal at a linear rate. These results hold for any constraint set (convex or nonconvex) providing convergence guarantees to the global optimum even when the objective function and constraint set is nonconvex. Furthermore, these results hold with a number of measurements that is only a constant factor away from the minimal number of measurements required to uniquely identify the unknown signal. Our results provide the first provably tractable algorithm for this data-poor regime, breaking local sample complexity barriers that have emerged in recent literature. In a companion paper we demonstrate favorable properties for the optimization problem that may enable similar results to continue to hold more globally (over the entire ambient space). Collectively these two papers utilize and develop powerful tools for uniform convergence of empirical processes that may have broader implications for rigorous understanding of constrained nonconvex optimization heuristics. The mathematical results in this paper also pave the way for a new generation of data-driven phase-less imaging systems that can utilize prior information to significantly reduce acquisition time and enhance image reconstruction, enabling nano-scale imaging at unprecedented speeds and resolutions.},

@article{Ma2017,
abstract = {Recent years have seen a flurry of activities in designing provably efficient nonconvex procedures for solving statistical estimation problems. Due to the highly nonconvex nature of the empirical loss, state-of-the-art procedures often require proper regularization (e.g. trimming, regularized cost, projection) in order to guarantee fast convergence. For vanilla procedures such as gradient descent, however, prior theory either recommends highly conservative learning rates to avoid overshooting, or completely lacks performance guarantees. This paper uncovers a striking phenomenon in nonconvex optimization: even in the absence of explicit regularization, gradient descent enforces proper regularization implicitly under various statistical models. In fact, gradient descent follows a trajectory staying within a basin that enjoys nice geometry, consisting of points incoherent with the sampling mechanism. This "implicit regularization" feature allows gradient descent to proceed in a far more aggressive fashion without overshooting, which in turn results in substantial computational savings. Focusing on three fundamental statistical estimation problems, i.e. phase retrieval, low-rank matrix completion, and blind deconvolution, we establish that gradient descent achieves near-optimal statistical and computational guarantees without explicit regularization. In particular, by marrying statistical modeling with generic optimization theory, we develop a general recipe for analyzing the trajectories of iterative algorithms via a leave-one-out perturbation argument. As a byproduct, for noisy matrix completion, we demonstrate that gradient descent achieves near-optimal error control --- measured entrywise and by the spectral norm --- which might be of independent interest.},

We investigate systematically the asymptotic behavior of AAR in the general case when the sets do not necessarily intersect and show that the method produces best approximation pairs provided they exist. Finitely many sets are handled in a product space, in which case the AAR method is shown to coincide with a special case of Spingarn's method of partial inverses.},

abstract = {In recent years, the mathematical and algorithmic aspects of the phase retrieval problem have received considerable attention. Many papers in this area mention crystallography as a principal application. In crystallography, the signal to be recovered is periodic and comprised of atomic distributions arranged homogeneously in the unit cell of the crystal. The crystallographic problem is both the leading application and one of the hardest forms of phase retrieval. We have constructed a graded set of benchmark problems for evaluating algorithms that perform this type of phase retrieval. The data, publicly available online, is provided in an easily interpretable format. We also propose a simple and unambiguous success/failure criterion based on the actual needs in crystallography. Baseline runtimes were obtained with an iterative algorithm that is similar but more transparent than those used in crystallography. Empirically these grow exponentially in a new hardness parameter: the sparsity of the signal autocorrelation. We also review the algorithms used by the leading software packages. This set of benchmark problems, we hope, will encourage the development of new algorithms for the phase retrieval problem in general, and crystallography in particular.},
